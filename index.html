	<h2>The Great Robert Plant</h2>
	<br><p> Robert Plant is arguably the best blues singer of all time - known as the leader singer of the famous rock 'n roll group Led Zeppelin. Plant was involved with Jimmy Page in their first band The Yardbirds and eventually turned into the well known band that's played "Stairway to Heaven", "Black Dog" and "Whole lotta love". Although Plant is a vocalist and lyricist, he originally sought out a traditional life and was an accountant. However, he decided very early on that the traditional path was not the one for him. </p>
	<p>Plant was born in 1948 and is still preforming today with his band - Robert Plant and the Sensational Space Shifters. The newest sound of his voice is alongside a mixture between folk and psychadelic rock. Although this band sounds a lot different than Led Zeppelin's iconic sound - it is his newest project and he even preforms Led Zeppelin songs with his own twist on them. Plant has experienced many hardships such as divorce, the death of his son, and the breakup of Led Zeppelin although having such great years with the different band members. Plant has been involved in other bands after Led Zeppelin such as touring with Pirory of Brian, Strange Sensation, Allison Krauss, Band of Joy, and the Sensational Space Shifters. </p>
